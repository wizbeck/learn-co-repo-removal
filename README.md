# GitHub API Repo Removal Tool

## Background
After completeing my bootcamp where we forked/cloned lots of lessons and practices, I thought it mucked up the history of my coding journey, and found it a good idea to remove some of those repos based on a specific name. I've heard other bootcampers from the same school had done a similar side project, so I wanted to give this a shot

## Learning with this project
This project gives me good experience with the following things:
- Dealing with an API
- Learning about GitHub's API specifically to understand some potential datapoints and data attributes that I could use in other projects
- Organizing code in a more object oriented approach
